# Bank Management System

In a rapidly evolving digital age, the world of banking is undergoing a transformation, ushering in unprecedented convenience, security, and efficiency.

As traditional banking systems have expanded to encompass global markets, the need for innovative solutions to meet the demands of an increasingly tech-savvy customer base has become paramount. 

The BMS addresses this need by providing a modern, easy-to-use, and secure banking solution through the use of Java Swing and a robust database connection.
## Technology Stack

• Java Development Kit (JDK)  
• MySQL Database  
• Java Swing for GUI
## System Architecture
The Banking Management System (BMS) is designed using a client-server architecture
model. Here's an overview of the architecture:

‣ 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐒𝐢𝐝𝐞   
User Interface (UI): The client-side comprises the graphical user interface (GUI)
created using Java Swing. Users interact with the system through this UI.

‣ 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐢𝐝𝐞  
Database Management System (DBMS): The system employs a MySQL database to
store user account information and transaction records securely.

‣ 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧  
𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞: This table stores user information, including names, addresses, and PINs.
Accounts Table: It stores account details, including the account number, account
type, and account balance.

𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞: Records of all financial transactions are stored here, including
deposit and withdrawal details.
